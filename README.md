## ar-to-en
A NodeJs simple script that converts and Arabic text sent by mistake as English text.

Add both files ar-to-en.js and toen.bat (Windows or write some .sh for linux) to an exposed
folder to Path in environment variables so you can call it as simple as:

```js
  $ toen "خن يثشق"
  ok dear
```
